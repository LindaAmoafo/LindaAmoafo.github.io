I am a [Population Health Science](https://medicine.utah.edu/population-health-sciences) PhD candidate with the [biostatistics emphasis](https://medicine.utah.edu/population-health-sciences/divisions/biostatistics) at the [University of Utah School of Medicine](https://medicine.utah.edu/).

I am currently working under the supervision of [Dr. Yue Zhang](https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail/u0892412) on developing distributed lag models for assessing windows of susceptibility to acute exposure to mixed environmental risk factors in the case-crossover design using Bayesian inference, and [Daniel Scharfstein, SCD](https://medicine.utah.edu/population-health-sciences/dscharf) on developing a semi-parametric sensitivity analysis tool for unmeasured confounding in observational setting with a time-to-event outcome subject to right censoring. Broadly I am interested in clinical trials, causal inference, survival analysis, machine learning, Bayesian statistics and environmental statistics.

I received my master's degree in statistics at the [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/), and my Bachelor's degree also in statistics from the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://statacts.knust.edu.gh/)

Here is my updated [CV](http://LindaAmoafo.github.io/files/Linda_Appiagyei_Amoafo_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). 

I enjoy paticipating in group fitnese and like hanging out with friends when I get the chance.
